### `Twig Coding Challenge`

The goal of this exercise is to write some executable code.
You should implement a function or class that can be called on to provide the following behaviour:
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N
equally sized arrays.
Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal
to the remainder..

## Run the code.

Clone the project to your machine and use VS code to run the file.
`git clone https://github.com/MarwanMbarki/arraychunk.git`
